        Hello, and welcome to my website! Here you'll be able to find out a bit more about me, what I'm interested
        in and why I'm here today.
        As a short little introduction, my name is Samantha Tilo (Sam or Sammy works great). I am 24 years old and
        am currently living in Saratoga Springs after moving back from Los Angeles in March. I've moved around the 
        US quite a bit growing up due to both my parents being in the Navy but I've lived in Utah for the better
        part of 8 years.

      <h4>Why am I here?</h4>
      <p class="hp">
        Up until this point I've attended Utah Valley University on and off since I graduated high school, have
        switched my major a handful of times and have since not been able to make it work. The school is great! 
        But I'm not sure it's a route meant for me.
        I decided to take a year long break at the end of fall semester in 2018 and moved to Los Angeles. I had
        no goal other than to admit out loud that I need this long of a break from school and have fun and 
        experience something new, free of the worry of school weighing on me. My hope was that taking this step
        back from my studies would help me refocus and find something I could be passionate about.
        I'm still not sure if I could call it a passion yet but after my break my interest in computer science
        still stands. Moving back and realizing this was my motivation to have a fresh start and try something 
        new.
        After this break my interest in computer science still stands. I've taken a few university courses in Python
        d C# languages a couple years ago but have relatively little experience with coding.
        I'm hoping that I can grow what I learn from this bootcamp into something that I really love and can turn 
        it into a career.
      </p>
    
      <h4>Moving Forward</h4>
      <p class="hp">
        Honestly I'm pretty nervous about this program. I've taken a few university courses in Python and C# a couple
        years ago but have relatively little experience with coding outside of that. I know this program is meant
        to be challenging and I'm hoping that the accelerated pace will motivate me to work hard. It'll be stressful
        I'm sure, but it never hurts step out of your comfort zone every once in a while. 
        I don't know exactly what direction I want to take following graduating DevPoint Labs but at the very least
        I hope that this bootcamp will allow me to grow what I learn in the next three months into something that I
        really love and can turn into a career in whichever way that path unfolds.
