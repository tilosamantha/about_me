      I've had some level of familiarity with Korean culture for as long as I can remember. Having lived in Hawaii when I
      was yonger, the culture there is its own fusion of local Hawaiian culture with heavy asian influences, especially
      from Japanese and Korean. I have family members who are mixed Korean and have had Korean friends all growing up as well.
      Most of my interest in learning a new language had been focused in Spanish and I studied that all through high school
      alongside some American Sign Language classes my senior year. 
    </h5>
    <h5>
      It wasn't until a couple years after I had graduated that I became interested in learning Korean. One of my friends was very into Kpop and had showed me a couple songs from her
      favorite artists. It was sometime around then that I became fascinated by the idea of learning a new alphabet. Learning
      a new written language added a whole new level of interest for me so most of my efforts in loosely studying Spanish
      switched to Korean. It's definitely become a hobby now and I don't follow a strict study schedule but it is something
      I have a lot of fun with learning when I have free time.
    </h5>
    <h5>
      There's not a lot that I can show you other than an explanation of this one interest I have so it's more a page for me and
      to help me make this website. SO. Below I have linked a bunch of resources that I personally like to use to help me study.

    <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/">How To Study Korean</a>
    <p>
      This is the main resource that I use to study and I really like it. Compared to any other free online resource available, this
      particular website breaks down learning the language in the simplest terms. The give many different examples to help understand
      any given concept and cover grammar very in depth. This has been a very useful reference guide for me whenever I come across
      something I'm not sure of while I'm reading something in Korean.
    </p>

    <a href="https://en.dict.naver.com/#/main">Naver Dictionary</a>
    <p>
      Another useful resource is the Naver Korean Dictionary. I mostly use this as a mobile app on the go since it's pretty handy that
      way. Basically if I'm watching a show or reading something in Korean I can look up the word in English or using the Korean
      keyboard and I'm able to pull up the translation and example sentences as well.
    </p>

    <a href="https://talktomeinkorean.com/">Talk To Me In Korean</a>
    <p>
      This is probably one of the most popular resources I've seen that others also wanting to learn Korean use. Though I don't use it
      very often now, they have a lot of different routes you can take with learning from them. The creators have a Youtube channel that
      they upload to often, they also have a podcast and workbooks that can either be printed off as PDFs or bought from their online
      shop. Like any other language, hearing and speaking is half the work. Having access lessons about the spoken language is helpful to
      improve pronunciation and als train your ear to what a native speaker can sound like versus what we read on paper.

      <p>On top of all these self led studies, what helps me apply what I learn is by consuming Korean media. I like to watch Korean films and shows
      with both Korean and English subtitles on (if both are available). This helps me to compare both the words to each other and expand my 
      vocabulary. It also helps me get used to sentence structure since it is so different from English. I'm also getting better at reading!
