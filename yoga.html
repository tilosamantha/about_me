    <h5>Yoga has never been one of my main choices of exercise. I find it incredibly frustrating and couldn't ever seem to find an appreciation for it.
      Back in December of 2019 for whatever reason I made it my goal to get into yoga. I wanted to be able to see what was so great about it.
    </h5>

    <h5>
      I'm still not very strict with practicing yoga. I have some weeks where I am more commited than others. Recently I've recruited some friends to help keep me motivated and it works... sometimes.
      But I think I can safely say that I've made my peace with it now. It provides me with a mental break from work and studies, it's helped ease back pain for me and I feel good doing it.
      Yoga isn't ever an activity that I'd say is my favorite part of my day, but practicing it definitely has a positive influence in other aspects of my life.

    <h5>One Youtuber in particular has made this yoga exploration bareable and I'll link some of her videos below.</h5>

      <p>This right here is Adrienne. She's great. She's got a good positive energy in her videos but also has a kooky side that makes
      an appearance every once in a while. To me at least the 'serenity' of yoga can be a little much and Adrienne doesn't make you
      feel like you have to take it so seriously.

        This is the playlist that I started at the beginning of the enforced quarantine. Besides my original goal to fall in love with
        yoga, I also wanted to take advantage of all the extra time I had and do something that felt productive. I enlisted a friend to 
        start it with me and ended up picking up another friend halfway through. Committing to a 30 day challenge was... challening. But!
        It was a great motivator for me to stay on top of exercising in general, even if it was 20 minutes in the morning to start my day.
