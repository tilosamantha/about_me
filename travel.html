    <h5>My first trip out of the country was with my family in 2016 to Western Samoa, where my dad is from.
      I've always had a mild interest in seeing the world like anyone else but this trip seemed to dawn on 
      me that traveling can be a reachable goal. It also brought out my interest in learning about other 
      cultures. I didn't grown up in a strictly Polynesian culturally driven household and I had the opportunity 
      to see what that truly looks like and where my family is from. From there I became more interested 
      interested in different cultures, both around the world and from region to region within the US. Since 
      then I've taken trips around the country to places like Seattle, Washington DC and San Antonio. I also 
      took a vacation with my sister to South Korea last year. Unfortunately due to current circumstances I had 
      to cancel a spring trip to Japan that would've happened a month ago now, but I still plan to make that trip 
      a reality in the future!

    <p>Though Japan was next on the agenda to visit, I have a bunch of other places that I'd like to travel to. Here's a list of countries that I'm most looking forward to going to:</p>
    <ul id="country">
      <li>Vietnam
        <br>

        <img class="photo" src="./images/halong.png" />
        <figcaption class="caption">Ha Long Bay is located in northern Vietnam. Within the bay is scattered thousands of limestone islands.</figcaption>
        <p id="travel">Vietnam has been moving up my list for a while now. There's a lot of natural beauty and history here that I'd like
          to experience first hand. I'm not too familiar with the culture either but I find it intriguing enough I'd like to visit.
          I'd also love to try all their food!

      <li>England
        <br>
        <img class="photo" src="./images/st.png" />
        <figcaption class="caption">St Michael's Mount, an island in Cornwall, England</figcaption>
        <br>
        <img class="photo" src="./images/henge.png" />
        <figcaption class="caption">Stonehenge, best known prehistoric monument in Europe</figcaption>
        <p id="travel">
          England is a trip that I hope to make my next. Just like the rest of Europe, England has so much rich history
          to explore and see. It's probably the place on this list that I've researched the least but it's still some
          place that if someone offered me a ticket to go, I'd take it and run no questions asked.
        </p>

      <br>

      <li>
        New Zealand
        <br>
        <img class="photo" src="./images/glow.png" />
        <figcaption class="caption">Waitomo glow worm caves on the north island</figcaption>

        <img class="photo" src="./images/hobbit.png" />
        <figcaption class="caption">LotR Hobbiton film location in Waikato on the north island</figcaption>
        <p id="travel">New Zealand has been the longest standing country on my list of places to visit yet. After living in Hawaii, I've wanted
          to see more of island life in other places. Besides the beaches and waters, there's a ton of film locations here that I'd 
          love to see. The glow worm caves pictured above looks like you're entering another world. I've never seen anything like it
          before.

      <li>
        Germany

        <figcaption class="caption">Berlin Cathedral</figcaption>

        <figcaption class="caption">Neuschwanstein Castle located in the Bavarian Alps in southern Germany</figcaption>
        <br>
        <p id="travel">There is a lot of history coming out of Germany that I'd love to dive into. A lot of WW2 history as well as modern. Like most
          of Europe their architechture is incredible as pictured in the photos above. There's so much sightseeing to do that I think
          any of it would be worth traveling to.
